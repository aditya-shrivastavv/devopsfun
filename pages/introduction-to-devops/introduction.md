# Introduction to DevOps 🚀

## Meet John Rofrano, Senior Technical Staff Member, and DevOps Champion at IBM Research

Hi, I’m **John Rofrano**, Senior Technical Staff Member, and DevOps Champion at **IBM Research**. Welcome to **Introduction to DevOps**. In this course, I'll guide you through the transformative journey of DevOps, a practice essential for success in the fast-paced tech world.

## Why DevOps Matters 💡

DevOps isn't just a buzzword. It's a cultural and technological shift crucial for the success of modern businesses. Consider this: according to a recent **DevOps Institute report**, the demand for DevOps skills is expected to grow by **122%** over the next five years, making it one of the **fastest-growing skills** in the workforce. However, it's not just about skills or tools. **Cultural change** is the linchpin. Gartner predicts that **75%** of DevOps initiatives will fail due to issues around **organizational learning and change**.

## The Heart of DevOps ❤️

DevOps isn't merely a tool or a job title. It's the **practice** of development and operations engineers collaborating throughout the software development lifecycle. By following **Lean** and **Agile** principles, teams can deliver software **rapidly** and **continuously**. **Cultural change** is at the core. As **George Spafford** from Gartner emphasizes, “People-related factors tend to be the greatest challenges—not technology.”

## Key Aspects of DevOps

### 1. **Thinking Differently 🤔**

DevOps challenges traditional thinking. We'll explore concepts like **social coding**, **software reuse**, and **minimum viable products**. Working in **small batches** reduces waste, while techniques like **test-driven development** ensure high **code quality**.

### 2. **Working Differently 🛠️**

Embracing **Continuous Integration** and **Continuous Delivery** ensures every change contributes to a **shippable feature**. Remember, “**Tools are not the solution to a cultural problem**.”

### 3. **Organizing Differently 🌐**

Team culture directly impacts software design. How you **organize your teams** shapes your product. Foster core values like **teamwork**, **accountability**, and **trust**.

### 4. **Measuring Differently 📊**

Change your **measurement system** to encourage the right behavior. Avoid vanity metrics; focus on **actionable metrics** to gain valuable insights about your product and customers.

## Embracing Change and Collaboration 👥

Implementing DevOps isn’t easy, but it's incredibly rewarding. **Experimentation** is key—every failure is a learning opportunity. Embrace **teamwork**, **accountability**, and **trust**. Remember, **we don’t “do” DevOps… we “become” DevOps**!

Join me in this transformative journey. Watch the videos, take the quizzes, and **collaborate with your peers**. DevOps is a team sport, and **collaboration is the key**.
