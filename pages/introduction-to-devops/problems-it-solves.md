# The Problems with Waterfall Method and Siloed Development üö´

Understanding the roots of DevOps requires recognizing the issues that plagued traditional software development methods, specifically the Waterfall approach. This approach, characterized by its rigid phases and lack of collaboration, created significant challenges in the software development lifecycle.

## Problems with the Waterfall Method üíß

### 1. **Lack of Provision for Change**

- **Rigid Phases**: Waterfall methodology lacks provisions for revisiting phases once they end. Changes in design or requirements after a phase concludes are challenging to implement.

### 2. **No Intermediate Deliveries**

- **Late Feedback**: No intermediate deliveries mean stakeholders only see the product at the end, making it hard to address issues early in the process.

### 3. **Information Loss and Delays**

- **Blocked Progress**: Issues passed down between phases create blocks and delays, leading to long lead times between deliveries.
- **Opportunity for Mishaps**: Passing information between phases can result in errors or misunderstandings, increasing the likelihood of costly mistakes.

### 4. **Silos and Lack of Collaboration**

- **Isolated Teams**: Teams work in silos, unaware of the impact their work has on other phases. Designers, coders, and testers operate independently, leading to communication gaps and inefficiencies.
- **Operations Unawareness**: The operations team, furthest from the development process, is expected to manage the code despite having limited knowledge, creating challenges in deployment and maintenance.

## Traditional Relationship Between Software Development and Operations ‚õìÔ∏è

- **Siloed Work**: Developers and operations teams worked **independently**, without collaboration or understanding of each other's roles and challenges.

## Conclusion: Embracing DevOps for Collaboration and Efficiency üåü

In retrospect, the Waterfall method's inherent limitations necessitated a shift in how software development and operations were approached. DevOps emerged as a response, focusing on **collaboration, communication, and shared responsibility** to bridge the gaps, enhance agility, and ensure a seamless software development and deployment process.
